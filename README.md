**#Create a Simple Web Application**
Now we can create a web controller for a simple web application, as the following listing (from src/main/java/demo/DemoController.java) shows name , agae and city:

We embarked on the development of an application using Spring Boot, commencing with the utilization of Spring Initializr. Our initial task involved creating a simple web application within the Spring Boot framework. To meet our project requirements, we carefully selected the necessary components from Star.spring.io. We opted for Maven as our project management tool, Java as the programming language, and Spring Boot version 3.0.8. We assigned the group name as com.project, artifact name as demo, package name as demo, and provided a descriptive project title. We opted for the Jar packaging option and set the Java version to 17. To enable specific functionalities, we included dependencies such as Spring Web (RESTful, MVC, Apache Tomcat). Once the project files were generated, we extracted them and imported them into IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, selecting the appropriate file path.

Next, we proceeded to create a web controller for our simple web application. We opened the corresponding file in IntelliJ IDEA and executed the code. To ensure the smooth operation of the application, we added relevant annotations and configured application properties as necessary. Once the coding part was completed, we tested the application locally by accessing it through the designated port 8080. Additionally, we implemented Git version control, annotating the initial file with Git to track changes effectively.

Upon successful login to the Git repository, we established a Spring Boot project by leveraging the Spring Boot repository. This marked a significant milestone in our project's progress, allowing us to move forward with the subsequent steps.
